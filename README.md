# PES_Project
We are going to build a IoT based Air Pollution Monitoring System using an Arduino 
Nano 33 BLE Sense. Air pollution is a growing issue all over the world specially in
third world countries. The reason for increasing the pollution level is increasing 
the use of vehicles, industrialization and urbanization that is affecting human health 
badly, i.e, allergic reactions such as irritation of the throat, nose, eye as well as heart 
problem, pneumonia, lungs diseases and aggravated asthma. According to the WHO, every year 
almost seven million people died worldwide because of air pollution. So monitoring air pollution 
is so important to improve air quality.
